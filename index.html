Firefox doesn't support the old way to access passwords, and
I have no idea now to access them using WebAPI. I tried all, and it just doesn't work.
<p>
So if you really need to mass-update your password, do this:<p>

<ul>
<li>Click "Generate Script". Some code will be copied to clipboard.
<li>From menu select "Tools/Web Developer/Browser Console", (or press Ctrl+Shift+J).
<li>Right click on the input line at the bottom and paste the code there, and press Enter. You will be asked further there for password change.
</ul>

<script src="opt.js"></script>
